								<h4>What i like to do</h4>
								Modular Frameworks development was used because of it's ability for reused, re-enhanced or redeveloped from current set of modules that already being part of the system core that we used in our own CMS (Content Management System). Modular Frameworks was also a part of Rapid Application Development (RAD) in software development methodology. I used it because of it's fast and robust rapid prototyping, allowing to cut production time becoming even faster for new projects to come.
			Authentication is the most vital in web development, therefore Role Based Access Control was variety used widely in web development protocols which happens I've used it practically.

								<h4>Mobile Application Development</h4>
								WebView in Android Apps makes development possible to create a Native Application that can communicate with mobile hardware using just only HTML, CSS and Javascript so we can defined it as Hybrid Android App. People like me in web development field can jump right in just using HTML5, CSS, Javascript to create an Android Apps and having to get familiar about java language little bit at a time. IDE used for the practices was Netbeans 7.1.2 with NBAndroid Plugins, JQuery Mobile or Bootstrap for the apps. PhoneGap for the hardware connector used for the development process. API, Json and RESTFul web service used for data retrieval or just plain HTML5 data storage. Mobile Application Development is possible with all the mobile handset that have webview / UiWebView property.
								And now <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/" title="Facebook React Native">React Native</a> showed me another level of mobile aplication development.

								<h4>UI Design and Frontend Development</h4>
								User interfaces is also important aspect for users to interact, communicate with browsers and having an experience of how it all works. For me, designing UI and developing Frontend is to get know how a user is experiencing on a process that allowing to keeping them having the use of my works.

							<div>
								<h4>Cloud Computing</h4>
								These amazing tool sets was part of modern Web Application Development. From Amazon to Microsoft and Google had taken their part in these tools. By happens some of my project was also implemented in cloud computing services. I am familiar and had been working with Azure, AWS, GoDaddy, Google Cloud and Digital Ocean Servers.
